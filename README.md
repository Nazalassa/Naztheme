## Naztheme

A <strike>simple</strike> alternate theme for KSP. Use at yiur own risk (but it should be safe).

### Installation

* Install [HUDReplacer](https://github.com/UltraJohn/HUDReplacer/releases) if you haven't installed it yet
* Download either the .zip or the .tar.gz file (not the source code!), unzip it, you should find a directory named `Naztheme`.
* Copy the directory into `GameData`. Please do not put it in another directory, as if you do HUDReplacer won't load the images (unless you change the config).
* Launch the game and enjoy!

### Dependencies
Requires [HUDReplacer](https://github.com/UltraJohn/HUDReplacer/releases).
